    <h2>Israeli Salad</h2>
        <p>For those of you who aren't familiar with Israeli Salad, here's a little background. It evolved from a Turkish salad known as shepherd's salad -<strong>coban salatsi</strong> , which is closely related to a Persian salad known as salad <strong>shirazi</strong>, named for the ancient city of Shiraz. <em>The salad is known under different names with slight ingredient variations throughout the Middle East.</p></em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Persian cucumbers</li>
            <li>1 lb fresh ripe tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/3 cup minced onion (optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced fresh parsley</li>
            <li>3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the Persian cucumber in half lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Then slice each half into 4 slices lengthwise, so you have 8 long, thin pieces total.</li>
            <li>Hold the long, thin pieces together with one hand, and slice the bunch into very small pieces with the other hand.</li>
            <li>Dice tomatoes.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Dice onions.</li>
            <li>Place the diced cucumbers into a large mixing bowl along with all the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix until vegetables are well coated with parsley, oil, lemon juice, and salt.</li>
            <li>Best served fresh at room temperature. You can also serve chilled for a more refreshing salad.</li>
        </ol>
